## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: I deserve 20/20 on this assignment. 

## Self-Reflection: 
I tried my hardest on this and ran into many bumps but got through almost all of them. I attempted to reach out for help in both Teams and to the proffessor and unfortunately the professor never showed up to our meeting :(.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took around 5 or 6 hours to finish this. The instructions were unclear for many points and hard to follow. There were many times that I followed the instructions word for word and some of the instructions lead me the wrong way because of the wording.
